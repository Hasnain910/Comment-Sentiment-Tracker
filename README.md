# Comment-Sentiment-Tracker

Hello!

I've created a code that tracks customer sentiments.
For this specific module, I'm doing it based on a small sample of 'positive' words and 'negative' words. 

It uses preprocessing, tokenization, score calculation based on key words and finally sentiment assignment.
